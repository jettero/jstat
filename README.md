Nothing to see here. Move along.

# Seriously

I'll probably never finish this. And I don't want to slight dstat in any way.
It's really slick and has everything you need.

# Plugins

Except plugins of course. I mean, it has a lot of plugins built in. But I don't
see tons of plugins to download… I mean, there are some, but not a ton. Why is
that exactly?

Well, mostly cuz it has everything you need.

# But also, traffic classes

I tried to write a traffic class plugin for dstat that would show me all my
traffic classes meaningfully in the dstat scrolly. I made it work, but it wasn't
a satisfying experience and I don't use it.

I started writing this instead.

# The actual goal if there is one

My actual goal is just to write some hobby code. I don't intend to actually ever
finish this project. I mean, you never know I guess.

I'm trying to learn to use pluggy to design a dstat-like program that's fun to
extend. I'd like for it to feel like dstat but be really fun for people to write
plugins for… plugins, btw, for both content (like reading /proc or iptables or
whatever) and visualizations.

It'd be slick if there was a regular `print()` scroller and a curses scroller
you can interact with, and a bunch of plugins that generate directed acyclic
graphs (of what I have no idea) and something that forwards to Splunk and blah
blah blah.

# But again

Move along. I'm just having fun here.
